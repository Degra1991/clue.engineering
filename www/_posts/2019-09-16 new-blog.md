As of today, this website is now built using [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) as a static site generator. Most notably, this means that all blog posts should load much faster now that they have been imported from external Gists into static files. All existing page links have been migrated as is and should continue working just like before. If you find any broken links, please drop me a line and I'll take a look!

On top of this, I've migrated all blog comments to [utterances](https://utteranc.es/). Blog comments are now embedded directly from GitHub issue comments using a simple JavaScript. This means leaving a comment should now be easier than ever, give it a try.

Both changes mean that content is now solely hosted in a single GitHub repository which significantly eases maintenance, gives more control over the website contents, presentation and eases drafting new content. Stay tuned for upcoming posts üçª
