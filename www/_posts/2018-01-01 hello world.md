Without further ado, let me start with saying:

```php
<?php

echo 'Hello World!';
```

Yes, it's about time!

Over the course of the last year or two I've been asked a number of times to share some background info about some of the projects I'm working on and where one can find my blog. Up until now I've had to console people with project documentation and my Twitter timeline. But not anymore.

If you stumble upon this blog post, there's a fair chance you may be among them or that you already have an idea of who I am. In case you don't, here's a short recap.

## Who Am I?

Hello, my name is Christian "[@another_clue](https://twitter.com/another_clue)" Lück. Nowadays, people mostly recognize me as a maintainer of [ReactPHP](https://reactphp.org), public speaker and Freelance Software Engineering Consultant.

This means that I'm involved with open source software development both in my professional and personal life. And while I've been involved with open source software development for more than a decade and a half, so far, I haven't put much effort into publicizing my open source involvement. This very blog post is proof to my New Year's resolution and the effort to shed some light into what is happening behind the scenes.

## Looking forward

Accordingly, I'm aiming to establish this blog as the new home for everything related to software engineering in my personal and professional life. This includes past and future software engineering challenges and solutions, release plannings and roadmaps for projects I'm involved with and examples and use cases for integrating multiple of these projects to create shiny new things.

If you're interested in software engineering or want to learn more about what is happening behind the scenes in these projects, then this blog may be for you. In case nobody ends up reading any of these posts, then that's okay too and the posts will silently serve as a way to organize some of my thoughts. I will irregularly post software engineering insights that are relevant to my own work and that I feel more people should be aware of.

If you have any feedback or just want to reach out and say hello, I'm more than happy to hear back! Use the comment section below or send a tweet to [@another_clue](https://twitter.com/another_clue).

Cheers and Happy New Year!
