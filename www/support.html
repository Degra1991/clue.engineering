                The best way to help us is by letting us know you're out there.
                Start by sending a <em>hello</em> our way and perhaps let the world know

                (this could include feature additions, expressing wishes, reporting bugs,
                helping with visuals or documentation and much more), make sure to let
                us know. You can always file an issue in the respective open-source project
                issue tracker or reach out to us personally.

                If you want to support us financially, that's cool – but we don't expect
                you personally to <a href="#faq-donation">send money our way</a>.
                Instead, check if your employer is using one of our projects in a
                commercial project and if one of the above <a href="#sponsor">sponsor plans</a>
                or <a href="#consulting">custom consulting</a> makes sense for them
                to support our open-source work instead. If you're a solo developer,
                you can always start by spreading the word and letting the world know
                why you think one of our projects needs more attention ❤︎

                <a href="#faq-donation">Do you accept donations?</a>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Thank you for asking. At the current time, we do not want to ask individuals for a donation.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a number of reasons for this, perhaps most importantly we
                care about <strong>sustainable open-source</strong> and we think
                asking individuals for donations is <em>unfair</em>.
                Does your project rely on one of our open-source projects for its business critical features?
                Consider signing up for a <a href="#sponsor">sponsorship</a> instead.
                If you're not making any money with our projects, we wouldn't want to
                ask you to <em>donate</em> any money.
                If you want to show your support, you can <strong><a href="https://github.com/sponsors/clue">❤︎ sponsor</a></strong>
                us on GitHub, but we completely understand if you don't.
                Instead, let's wait until your project takes off and start by spreading the word! ❤︎
